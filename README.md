![viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/screenshots/master/apps/Viewer/viewer.png?v=2)

## 📋 Current support
- Images
- Videos

## 🏗 Development setup
1. ☁ Clone this app into the `apps` folder of your Nextcloud: `git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/viewer.git`
2. 👩‍💻 In the folder of the app, install dependencies with `npm ci` and build the Javascript with `npm run build`.
3. 🎉 Partytime!

### 🧙 Advanced development stuff
To build the Javascript whenever you make changes, you can also run `npm run dev` for development builds.

### 📷 Running cypress tests
To run e2e cypress tests, execute `npm run cypress`.

The `visual-regression` tests require additional care as they depend on installation of fonts in the application. To achieve repeatable results run the tests using `npm run cypress:visual-regression`. This will build the app with the required fonts and run the tests.

If changes are required to the reference (base) screenshots used by the `visual-regression` tests, run `cypress:update-snapshots` and commit the updated screenshots.

## API

### Add the viewer to your app
In php, on your page, emit the LoadViewer event.
Check the documentation/tutorial for more info on this type of page controller sample.
``` php
use OCA\Viewer\Event\LoadViewer;
use OCP\AppFramework\Controller;
use OCP\AppFramework\Http\TemplateResponse;
use OCP\EventDispatcher\IEventDispatcher;
use OCP\IRequest;

class PageController extends Controller {
	protected $appName;

	/** @var IEventDispatcher */
	private $eventDispatcher;

	public function __construct($appName,
								IRequest $request,
								IEventDispatcher $eventDispatcher) {
		parent::__construct($appName, $request);

		$this->appName = $appName;
		$this->eventDispatcher = $eventDispatcher;
	}

	/**
	 * @NoAdminRequired
	 * @NoCSRFRequired
	 * Render default index template
	 *
	 * @return TemplateResponse
	 */
	public function index(): TemplateResponse {
		$this->eventDispatcher->dispatch(LoadViewer::class, new LoadViewer());
		$response = new TemplateResponse($this->appName, 'main');
		return $response;
	}
}
```
This will load all the necessary scripts and make the Viewer accessible trough javascript at `OCA.Viewer`

### Open a file
1. Open a file on WebDAV and let the viewer fetch the folder data
  ```js
  OCA.Viewer.open({path: '/path/to/file.jpg'})
  ```
2. Open a file on WebDAV and provide a list of files
  ```js
  OCA.Viewer.open({
		path: '/path/to/file.jpg',
		list: [
			{
				basename: 'file.jpg',
				filename: '/path/to/file.jpg',
				...
			},
			...
		],
  })
  // Alternative: pass known file info so it doesn't need to be fetched
  const fileInfo = {
	filename: '/path/to/file.jpg',
	basename: 'file.jpg',
	mime: 'image/jpeg',
	etag: 'xyz987',
	hasPreview: true,
	fileid: 13579,
  }
  OCA.Viewer.open({
	fileinfo: fileInfo,
	list: [fileInfo],
  })
  ```
  The list parameter requires an array of fileinfo. You can check how we generate a fileinfo object [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/viewer/blob/master/src/utils/fileUtils.js#L97) from a dav PROPFIND request data. There is currently no dedicated package for it, but this is coming. You can check the [photos](https://github.com/nextcloud/photos) repository where we also use it.

3. Open a file from an app's route
  ```js
  const fileInfo1 = {
	filename: 'https://next.cloud/apps/pizza/topping/pineapple.jpg',
	basename: 'pineapple.jpg',
	source: 'https://next.cloud/apps/pizza/topping/pineapple.jpg',
	mime: 'image/jpeg',
	etag: 'abc123',
	hasPreview: false,
	fileid: 12345,
  }
  const fileInfo2 = {
	filename: 'https://next.cloud/apps/pizza/topping/garlic.jpg',
	basename: 'garlic.jpg',
	source: 'https://next.cloud/apps/pizza/topping/garlic.jpg',
	mime: 'image/jpeg',
	etag: 'def456',
	hasPreview: false,
	fileid: 67890,
  }
  OCA.Viewer.open({
	fileInfo: fileInfo1,
	list: [fileInfo1, fileInfo2],
  })
  ```

In order to open a shared file you will need to provide the share token
so the Viewer can use it to authenticate the requests to the server.
See the `files_sharing` app
[controller](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/apps/files_sharing/lib/Controller/ShareController.php#L404)
and
[template](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/master/apps/files_sharing/templates/public.php#L18)
for an example.

### Close the viewer
```js
OCA.Viewer.close()
```

### 🔍 Add you own file view

If you want to make your app compatible with this app, you can use the methods provided by the [`@nextcloud/viewer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nextcloud/viewer) npm.js package:
1. Create a vue component which use the `path` and `mime` props (they will be automatically passed by the viewer)
2. Register your mime viewer with the following:
   ``` js
    import { registerHandler } from '@nextcloud/viewer'
    import VideoView from 'VideoView.vue'

    registerHandler({
        // unique id
        id: 'video',

       // optional, it will group every view of this group and
       // use the proper view when building the file list
       // of the slideshow.
       // e.g. you open an image/jpeg that have the `media` group
       // you will be able to see the video/mpeg from the `video` handler
       // files that also have the `media` group set.
       group: 'media',

       // the list of mimes your component is able to display
       mimes: [
            'video/mpeg',
            'video/ogg',
            'video/webm',
            'video/mp4'
        ],

        // your vue component view
        component: VideoView
    })
   ```
3. Make sure your script is loaded with `\OCP\Util::addInitScript` so that the handler is registered **before** the viewer is loaded.
4. if you feel like your mime should be integrated on this repo, you can also create a pull request with your object on the `models` directory and the view on the `components` directory. Please have a look at what's already here and take example of it. 🙇‍♀️


### Legacy handler registration
> [!CAUTION]
> Using OCA.Viewer for registering your handlers is not recommended as this might break depending on the script loading order

If you want to make your app compatible with this app, you can use the `OCA.Viewer` methods
1. Create a vue component which use the `path` and `mime` props (they will be automatically passed by the viewer)
2. Register your mime viewer with the following:
   ``` js
    import VideoView from 'VideoView.vue'

    OCA.Viewer.registerHandler({
        // unique id
        id: 'video',

       // optional, it will group every view of this group and
       // use the proper view when building the file list
       // of the slideshow.
       // e.g. you open an image/jpeg that have the `media` group
       // you will be able to see the video/mpeg from the `video` handler
       // files that also have the `media` group set.
       group: 'media',

       // the list of mimes your component is able to display
       mimes: [
            'video/mpeg',
            'video/ogg',
            'video/webm',
            'video/mp4'
        ],

        // your vue component view
        component: VideoView
    })
   ```
3. Make sure your script is loaded with `\OCP\Util::addScript` (in contrast to using the API package)!
